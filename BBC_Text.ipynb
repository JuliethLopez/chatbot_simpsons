nicer to principal skinner if you know what i mean lisa i am nice homer i really appreciate you making dinner but this food tastes a little strange it hurts my teeth thats because ive loaded it with sugar marge our ship has come in i found five hundred pounds of sugar  in the forest  that im gonna sell directly to the consumer and all for a low low price of one dollar per pound but the grocery store sells sugar for thirtyfive cents a pound and it doesnt have nails and broken glass in it those are prizes ooo a blasting cap i won first chair whats happening oh it was just a dream i won first

idea note for later put rubber spider down lisas dress  hey i know how about if i dig up some dirt on allison remember how i got milhouses picture on americas most wanted i appreciate the offer but it goes against every moral fiber in my body suit yourself but if you change your mind heres my card i dont need a card you live in the room next to me note next year order fewer cards and you didnt think id make any money i found a dollar while i was waiting for the bus while you were out earning that dollar you lost forty dollars by not going to work the plant called and said if you dont come in tomorrow dont bother coming in monday woo hoo a four day weekend hey i am above average so what if allisons ahead of me theres no shame in being second why would they come to our concert just to boo us lis i did some checkin on this allison character and i know its against all your moral fibers yep shes clean as a bean but i did tip off the feds as to the whereabouts of our good friend milhouse ive got to stop being so petty i should be allisons friend not her competitor i mean she is a wonderful person way to go lis i mean why compete with someone whos just gonna kick your butt anyway i prefer my phrasing youre a wonderful person oh really i jeremys iron whats this youre finished already but the competition isnt for weeks its great its really great must protect sugar thieves everywhere the strong must protect the sweet the sweet homer in america first you get the sugar then you get the power then you get the women homer homer huh wha i want you to forget about guarding

i cant live the buttoneddown life like you i want it all the terrifying lows the dizzying highs the creamy middles sure i might offend a few of the bluenoses with my cockystride and musky odors oh ill never be the darling of the so called city fathers who cluck their tongues stroke their beards and talk about whats to be done with this homer simpson look just get rid of the sugar okay no hey get off my sugar bad bees bad ow ow oh theyre defending themselves somehow look bart it almost killed me but i handcrafted all seventyfive characters from oliver twist and now the coup de grace  a bitter snowstorm uh oh is it okay well the important thing is that we survived oh who am i kidding theres no way im ever gonna beat allison well sure there is  but it involves being a bit underhanded a bit devious a bit as the french say bartesque ill do whatever it takes then welcome to the nether regions of the soul now heres what we do tomorrow morning when allison comes out of her house we spray her with the hose soaking her from head to toe leaving us relatively dry relatively well theres bound to be some splashback bart her being wet wont help me win the competition well we could just sabotage her diorama humiliating her in front of the students and faculty perfect leaving her primed for the most traumatic hosesoaking of her life enough with the hose bees are on the what now deal nooooooo my sugar is melting melting oh what a world oh sugar im sorry homie its okay marge ive learned my lesson a mountain of sugar is too much for one man its clear now why god portions it out in those tiny packets and why he lives on a plantation in hawaii lisa here is as the french say le fake diorama ill create a diversion and you make the switch hey everybody whoa look at me im over here turn this way right now  its a cows heart theyre trying to make a monkey outta you right on  its the beating of that hideous heart i mean i think i hear something why heres allisons real diorama it got misplaced or so it would seem youre a shooin now lis after the way ive behaved i dont deserve to win what like what im really sorry about what i did allison its no shame being second to you only if were the best hey ralph want to come with me and allison to play anagrams this romance is so full of heartfelt passion i can really identify with this cornfed heroine homer are you awake this is

raised by this book hmmm i knew i shouldnt have put a fireplace in the bedroom  how many times can you laugh at that cat getting hit by the moon its a new episode not exactly they pieced it together from old shows and it seems new to the trusting eyes of impressionable youth really ren and stimpy do it all the time yes they do and when was the last time you heard anyone talk about ren and stimpy children your father and i have fed you and clothed you but weve neglected something more important its time to learn about love no need mom we already learned in school boring i mean romance not love mom romance is dead it was acquired in a hostile takeover by hallmark and disney homogenized then sold off piece by piece thats not true romance is all around us in our neighborhoods even on our jobs all you have to do is think about your most cherished memories hmmm hello is al there yeah al last name caholic no no no no ask your heart what its fondest desire is hm mmmm chocolate  mmmm invisible cola  mmmm forbidden donut  mmmm sacrilicious mmmm  mmmm free goo mmmm something no think about people about moments in your life that have been very romantic oh okay thats not the idea at all okay

brunch at all  that doesnt shock me is thursday okay thank goodness i drove down an ironic street i made the right decision to stay with my homie and there was no harm done so if you kind of mentally snip out the part where i already had a husband thats my idea of romance happy valentines marge i want you to stop seeing this jacque you can let him down gently but over the next couple of months i want you to break it off okay homer ooh that was a close one kids okay marge as long as were traumatizing the kids i have a scandalous story of my own hi gotta go i made it the whole day without

mother and well all go out to dinner thats not my mother they hit it off right away but there were rivals for the fair ladys hand but in the end just when things looked worse true love triumphed that

freezer who wants chocolate ice cream me me me me mr burns is the richest man in town maybe it was about money hey i said that my name is lisa simpson and i made a chart of all the suspects in the

way are you sure you dont want me to hold one of your ice cream cones yeah right you chose fruit you live with fruit  no no no ewww why is this on the floor and we dont even know whose gun that was maybe somebody planted it there to frame dad no we cant start thinking that way about our own family members suspicion could tear us apart so you finally learned my name eh ive got no time for your demented parlor games you wont be telling anyone else that homer simpson shot you the scene of the crime there must be something here that can clear dad thats it oh mr pigeon id kiss you if you werent swimming with disease so the dna was right it mustve been oh dad  stop dont shoot my dad hes innocent he wouldnt hurt a fly stop telling them it was me ill kill you for saying it was me say it burns

report together bart why are you doing that our class is making refreshments for skinners party these are in honor of his army days uh huh that explains the flags what about the dog food my theory is skinner likes dog food lets bake him a cake ooh a fresh batch of america balls mmm so in  a brave young man named seymour skinner enlisted and shipped out to vietnam where he rose to become platoon sergeant ralph sgt skinner was a hero he risked capture many times behind enemy lines and he survived to make it back to springfield where he became the fine educator we salute tonight i hope you all brought forks and plates thats not a funny story  principal skinner come on get to the part where you steal his identity oh its one of those stories look lady you obviously have at least one son hey armin mrs krabappel sent me i forged my dads signature on my report card well i dont see how me signing homers name is any different from you using sgt skinners name hey hey hey easy there you big impostor not to us youre not i mean how would you feel if you suddenly found out ned flanders was an impostor my nextdoor neighbor religious guy no i dont what i mean is to me youre just a stranger pretending to be something hes not im sorry but thats just how i feel i admit sgt skinner seems okay but mr tamzarian pulled himself up from the streets and earned our respect and admiration he lied about his name his name doesnt matter a rose by any other name would smell as sweet not if you called em stench blossoms or crapweeds id sure hate to get a dozen crapweeds for valentines day id rather have candy not if they were called scumdrops hey america youre so fine youre so fine you blow my mind america fair enough good morning agnes hows your new son working out and have ten items or less oh now be fair edna i liked armin tamzarian too but he was at least as big a weenie as sgt skinner did you ever tell him that okay once more where are we going and why are you and the old lady in the car and why is marge here i came up with the idea and why am i here because the streets of capitol city are no place for three unescorted ladies and why are the kids here because we couldnt find grampa to sit for them and why is grampa here can i see your copy of swank armin hey everybody look armin tamzarians back and hes gonna take over the school again all right all right so hes a fraud i dont care

children hike oh i shoulda punted turn it off turn it off hang on dad this next partll definitely make you feel better about yourself  stupid movies who invented these dumb things anyway was it you bart it was thomas edison dad i thought he invented the light bulb that too he also invented the phonograph the microphone and the electric car no one man can do all that youre a liar honey a dirty rotten liar its true i read it on a place mat at a restaurant really a restaurant well now i dont know what to think top of the world ma cut it out boy  dad what are you doin here reading about this edison character they wont let me in the big people library downtown there was some unpleasantness i can never go back ooh look at all the inventions edison came up with the stock ticker the storage battery even wax paper and look at him dance de de de de de thats great dad and these hardy boys books are great too this one is about smugglers theyre all about smugglers no not this one the smugglers of pirate cove its about pirates i think its pretty obvious that i am go school that doesnt sound like me well i suppose if this doesnt work out you can always go back to the plant not the way i quit oohwho yeah yeah yeah yeah great story lenny but heres one thats even more spellbinding once upon a time there was a man named thomas edison and he invented the dictating machine and the fluoroscope and the repeating telegraph  and he was a firm believer in fletcherism and he played the organ and his favorite flower was the heliotrope  oh and his middle name was alva and he never ever ever wore pajamas and well i remember where edison worked it was menlo park thats where he came up with the tasimeter the ore separator and thats boring youre boring everybody quit boring everyone  and then he worked on a machine to communicate with the dead some kind of scary telephone i guess or maybe he planned to just stick his head under the ground and yell all right already everyone knows the man accomplished a lot maybe because he didnt spend every waking moment talking about thomas edison ohh thats where youre wrong marge he was a shameless selfpromoter well youre not thomas edison marge thats it thats why i havent done anything with my life i need to be more like thomas edison whatever and im starting right now no more lousy pajamas from this day forward i am an inventor well i quit my job just like you said to i didnt tell you to quit your job yes you did i remember your exact words you said i should quit my job and become an inventor or youd torch the house at my age edison had already invented  things ohh ive got a lot of work to do to catch up to him lets see now inventions inventions something electrical might be good what eh eh let me handle the creative end of this marge you dont understand how the creative mind works like i do oh you look at this table and what do you see just a table now a creative person like me looks at this table and sees all kinds of creative things  but no tables homer thats not a table thats our dryer my files uh this isnt working ive got to try a different approach   youve started smoking dad yes thomas edison smoked several cigars a day yeah he invented stuff too shutup  as long as youre here annoying me lets have a brainstorming session now heres how it works lisa you say one thing then bart you say another just toss out things and ill use my inventive mind to combine them into a brilliant original idea okay umm automatic butt okay fluorescent booger uhhuh a wait a minute these arent exciting new products youre not even trying okay thats it both of you go to your rooms and spank yourselves lazy father cant even spank his own kids homer you cant punish the children just because you cant come up with an idea i dont see why not theyre my kids i own em  okay we own em what happened you didnt fall hm i brought you a tuna sandwich they say its brain food i guess because theres so much dolphin in it and you know how smart they are ohhh its no use i cant work like this cut off from the scientific community you stay here and guard the sandwich look i just want to know how to invent things tell me you mean like an electric blanketmobile hamburger earmuffs thanks sucker okay i have here the four greatest inventions in the history of mankind first my allpurpose electric hammer for all your pounding needs ow probably needs to be more powerful i will buy ten of those right now now heres my everythings okay alarm this will sound every three seconds unless something isnt okay turn it off homer it cant be turned off but it does break easily now this next ones for the ladies how many times have you gals been late for a highpowered business meeting only to realize youre not wearing makeup thats every womans nightmare thats why i invented this revolutionary makeup gun its for the woman who only has fourfifths of a second to get ready close your eyes marge and now youre ready for a night on the town homer youve got it set on whore eh oh okay this time try to keep your nostrils closed oh look what you did now i have to get my cold cream gun dad women wont like being shot in the face women will like what i tell them to like now heres something for everyone in the olden times if you were watching tv and nature called youd have to get up and walk to the bathroom it was the hardest thing in the world to do but now with the lazy man reclining toilet chair you can just lean back and let er rip you expect people to go to the bathroom in their living rooms sure believe me every man in america will want to have one gangway gotta poop no bart homer all these inventions theyre yes theyre not very yes yes yes theyre terrible what im not saying youre a bad inventor im just saying these particular inventions are awful and no one in their right mind would buy them or accept them as gifts but this is the best i could do i guess im no better at being thomas edison than i was at being homer simpson oh dear i hope i wasnt too rough on him somebody had to tell him mom in the long run its much kinder to  do you mind all week my life long dream was to be the next thomas edison but now its over i guess ill just give up my hopes and dreams and settle for being a decent husband and father  homer  dad  look out oh that i stuck a couple of extra legs on there cause i kept tipping over when i was trying to invent stuff theyre on hinges thats really ingenious dad it could save lives really you think its a good idea oh yeah safety sells especially to lameos id buy one me too i did it im gonna be rich look mr edison i did it im an inventor and i owe it all to you see its just a regular chair but i attached a couple of extra legs to the back kinda like the ones on the back of your awdammit hey dad heard you swearing mind if i join in crap boobs crap i thought i had a great idea but i mustve seen it on this poster if edison thought of that chair how come its not on this chart its not maybe he never told anyone about it that chair might be the only one he made so so weve got to go to the edison museum and smash it then ill be an inventor but i thought you loved edison aw to hell with him yeah hell damn fart takingbartacrossstatelinesbacksoon i borrowed your wallet oh i just mopped that driveway man i cant wait to smash that chair oh son youre young and headstrong just like thomas edison jr you know he started a mushroom farm and an auto parts company and he sold his good name to a quack medicine company oh and later he raised turkeys that was on his turkey farm  all right the museums still open now lets take care of business outta the way this is one invention youre not getting credit for you inspiration hog your electric hammer maestro invent your way out of this edison look son edison was just like me you mean the wild mood swings no we both lived in another mans shadow this oldtimey nerd and i have suffered the same frustration and heartache were not rivals were just a couple of dreamers who set the bar a little too high i cant destroy your work my friend can i no but well stop off at the da vinci museum on the way home uh i think thats in italy

incompatible lisa lots of times two incompatible things can both be true my sons a brat but hes a special little guy your father says hes at work but there he is jumping on a trampoline mom you really have to choose here between science and belief well then i choose uh so according to creationism there were no cavemen good riddance their drawings suck and they look like hippies dad youre not really reconsidering evolution are you my mind is always open to new ideas onions in the peas what the hell i have an issue id like to raise last week the unscientific theory of creationism was introduced alongside evolution in springfield public schools evolution and creationism cannot coexist people it is time to go back to teaching one single truth im so glad you could all come ill be reading to you

and in love like all young people i had a musical dream a dream called inoffensive urban light hiphop smooth grooves but our happiness was about to unravel just like kevin costners career because of

dividing up a shared life i was so depressed i spent all my time in a bar i had finally realized every rock stars dream hating being famous a tale of two young outlaws in love unfortunately as i later learned that wasnt heroin it was insulin homer really did need those injections i had become diabetic from drinking too many frappuccinos with the nineties drawing to a close and the sydney olympics
